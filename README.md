	<h2 span style="color:Black">My Baby Bear</h2>
	<p  span style="color:Black">A teddy bear is a soft toy in the form of a bear. Developed apparently simultaneously by toymakers Morris Michtom in the U.S. and Richard Steiff in Germany in the early years of the 20th century, and named after President Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt, the teddy bear became an iconic children's toy, celebrated in story, song, and film.[1] Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs, "teddies" have greatly varied in form, style and material. They have become collector's items, with older and rarer "teddies" appearing at public auctions.[2] Teddy bears are among the most popular gifts for children and are often given to adults to signify love, congratulations, or sympathy.</p>
	<br>
	</br>
	<h2 span style="color:Black">Definition</h2>
	<p  span style="color:Black">The name teddy bear comes from former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, who was commonly known as "Teddy" (though he loathed being referred to as such).[3] The name originated from an incident on a bear hunting trip in Mississippi in November 1902, to which Roosevelt was invited by Mississippi Governor Andrew H. Longino. There were several other hunters competing, and most of them had already killed an animal.</p>

	<h2 span style="color:Black">Significant</h2>
	<p  span style="color:Black">Almost everyone has had that one stage in there life, It seems like everything that can go wrong does. Everyone you thought loved you no longer does. The whole world is against you. Or perhaps you did it in your younger years just for the feeling. But at one point in nearly everyoneâ€™s life, He or she needs some added security in his or her life. Not like that from a friend or family member, nore from any living creature for that matter. Something that he or she can talk to and tell his or her deepest secrets without worrying of them being let out to anyone. Something that can be held tightly and that will keep he or she safe from the harms of the world. Thusly where the Teddy bear makes its entrance.
